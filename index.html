                <h3>Lottery Rules</h3>
                <p>To participate in the lottery, each user pays $20.</p>
                <p>The lottery operates with the following rules:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every user must follow the main Telegram channel to participate.</li>
                    <li>Each user can increase their chances in the lottery by inviting friends. For each invited person who participates, you get an additional chance in the lottery.</li>
                    <li>If one of your invited friends wins, you receive a $1000 reward, but you stay in the lottery unless you win the grand prize ($7000).</li>
                    <li>If a user wins the grand prize of $7000, all their chances will be removed from the lottery, but they can still receive rewards for their friends’ wins.</li>
                    <li>Every week, 10 participants will be randomly selected to win $7000 each.</li>
                    <li>The lottery starts when 2 million people participate, and the total prize pool will be distributed among winners.</li>
                    <li>If you invite multiple people, and one of your chances wins, all remaining chances are void, and you exit the lottery.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Please ensure you accept the rules before proceeding.</p>
